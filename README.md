# BookLab

Welcome to BookLab, a React frontend and C# ASP.NET backend application.

[Blurb text to be confirmed]
[Mission statement as yet uncornfirmed]

## Project setup

Install the dependencies for the backend (in the `backend` folder) with:

```
dotnet restore
```

and in the frontend (in the `frontend` folder) with:

```
npm install
```

(if you get an error that mentions lockfile versions, upgrade npm with `npm install -g npm`)

See the below instructions for running the database - the first time you run it will download the official PostgreSQL Docker image and set up the database for the first time, which takes a little while!

## Project structure

The project consists of three separate services: the **database**, running inside a Docker container; the **API**, a C# ASP.NET app; and the **frontend**, a React single-page application.

The database runs through `docker-compose` in a Docker container with a persistent storage volume.

The backend is an ASP.NET web API, and exposes a set of API endpoints to be used by the frontent.

The frontend is written in Typescript React, using [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing.

## Running the project locally

To run the project locally, we need to start all three services separately (preferably in the following order).

### Running the database

Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed and running. Open up [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/), and create a new login-enabled role with the name and password of your choice (that you will remember). Create a database whose owner is that new role, probably called `booklab` or similar. Then, edit the file `database.env` to contain the information you just created!

### Running the backend

First, set the required environment variables for connecting to the database.

For local running in powershell, run:

```
$env:DATABASE_URL = "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/booklab"
$env:USE_SSL = "false"
```

Navigate to the `backend` folder and run:

```
dotnet watch run
```

It will run a file watcher and update when files are changed. Stop it with Ctrl+C.

### Running the frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and run:

```
npm start
```

It will run a file watcher and update when files are changed. Stop it with Ctrl+C.
